A Monorepo to store All Custom Applications needed to Administer Hanamizuki Cluster

## Note on Programming Languages
I will use a mix of as many programming languages as possible to expand my skills, so sorry if there are different languages for different apps. This variety helps me learn and experiment with different technologies while building the applications needed for the Hanamizuki cluster.
