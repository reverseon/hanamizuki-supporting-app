# DevOps Operations

## Current State: Manual Execution

This DevOps folder contains scripts and configurations that are **currently meant to be executed manually**. 

As this is a one-person project at the moment, the overhead of setting up automated CI/CD pipelines is not justified. Manual execution allows for:
- Quick iteration and testing
- Direct control over deployment timing
- Simplified debugging and troubleshooting
- Reduced infrastructure complexity

## Future Roadmap: Automated CI/CD

**When the project grows larger** and involves multiple team members, these operations should be integrated into an automated CI/CD pipeline. This will provide:
- Consistent and reliable deployments
- Reduced human error
- Better collaboration workflows
- Automated testing and validation
- Deployment history and rollback capabilities

## Usage

For now, execute the scripts in this folder manually as needed. Ensure you understand what each script does before running it in production environments.
